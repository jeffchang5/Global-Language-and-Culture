### What is the CulturesConnect Challenge?

CulturesConnect is a real world application in real time to connect people across cultures in oneâ€™s local community. Stepping away from the classroom and taking it to the street! Fun, engaging, and authentic meetups to gain language and cultural knowledge through immersion experiences right in your own neighborhood.

### Why do we use the word risk?

Whenever there is opportunity for growth, there is risk. Risk to step outside your comfort zone and do something new, meet someone new, taste, see, feel and experience a world of adventure across the myriad of cultures in your own backyard!
